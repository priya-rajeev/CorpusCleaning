# CorpusCleaning
This is a website built to help us clean our OEMCS (online English-Mandarin code-switching) corpus. This web interface lets participants verify our computationally segmented and tagged utterances.

Currently, the web interface pulls from a database of current samples that we have, and allows users to segment them. Once all samples are segmented, we will separate them to get the true size of our corpus.

In the future, we will also verify POS tagging with a similar interface.
