         Now we will ask you to clean a total of ten text samples. Each sample may be anywhere from just one sentence to a few sentences long. 
         The samples will consist of a mix of Mandarin and English words.
         <br/><br/>
         For each text sample, we will ask you to separate the sample into sentences, as done in the previous example.

            <strong>Please carefully read the following rules:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="list_item">
                Whenever you think a sentence ends, please place double vertical lines (||) at the end of the sentence. 
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <strong>For example, the following entry:</strong> 
                <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;
                I walked to the store today. I didn't buy anything, though.
                <br/><br/>&emsp;
                <strong>would become</strong>
                <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;
                I walked to the store today. || I didn't buy anything, though. ||
            </li>

            <li class="list_item">
                If the sentence is just a fragment, still place double vertical lines (||) at the end of the sentence.
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <strong>For example, the following entry:</strong>
                <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp; 
                Checking out a book
                <br/><br/>&emsp;
                <strong>would become</strong>
                <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;
                Checking out a book || 

            </li>

            <li class="list_item">
               Enclose all punctuation within the double vertical lines.
               <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <strong>For example, the following entry:</strong> 
                <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;
                I am really excited about the weather today! It's so nice outside...
                <br/><br/>&emsp;
                <strong>would become</strong>
                <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;
                I am really excited about the weather today! || It's so nice outside... ||
            </li>

            <li class="list_item">
                If there is a list of steps or bullet points, segment each bullet point into its own sentence.
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <strong>For example, the following list:</strong> 
                <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;Things to do this weekend: 
                <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; grocery shop

                <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp; go out to dinner

                Things to do this weekend || grocery shop || take a hike || go out to dinner ||
             </li>

            <li class="list_item">
                If there are any hyperlinks or email addresses, please include them in their own sentence (there should be a set of vertical bars before and after the link/email). Do this even if doing so will break up a sentence.
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <strong>For example, the following entry:</strong> 
                <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;
                For concerns about the job posting at google.com, please email the recruiter at recruiter@recruiter.com - thanks!

            </li>

            <li class="list_item">
                If there are any timestamps, please include them in their own sentence (there should be a set of vertical bars before and after the timestamp). Do this even if doing so will break up a sentence.
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <strong>For example, the following entry:</strong> 
                <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;
                I received a scam call at (2020-05-23 20:43 +8:00), which is an odd time to call.
                <br/><br/>&emsp;
                <strong>would become</strong>
                <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;
                I received a scam call at || (2020-05-23 20:43 +8:00) ||, which is an odd time to call.
            </li>

            <li class="list_item">
                If there are any emojis or emoticons, try to include them in whichever sentence seems closest to you.
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <strong>For example, the following entry:</strong> 
                <br/><br/>&emsp;&emsp;
                I'm so happy :) I ate some pancakes today!
                <br/><br/>&emsp;
                <strong>could become</strong>
