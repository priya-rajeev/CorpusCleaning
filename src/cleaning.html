         Now we will ask you to clean a total of ten text samples. Each sample may be anywhere from just one sentence to a few sentences long. 
         The samples will consist of a mix of Mandarin and English words.
         <br/><br/>
         For each text sample, we will ask you to separate the sample into sentences, as done in the previous example.
         <br/><br/>
         You can copy paste the text sample into the text area, then add in the vertical bars to segment the sentences.

            <strong>Please carefully read the following rules:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="list_item">
                Whenever you think a sentence ends, please place double vertical lines (||) at the end of the sentence. 
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <small>
                    <u>For example:</u> 
                    I walked to the store today. || I didn't buy anything, though. ||
                </small>
            </li>

            <li class="list_item">
                If there are any run-on sentences, please break them up to the best of your abilities. 
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <small>
                    <u>For example:</u> 
                    Has anyone else looked at the class homework yet || I have not and I don't know how to do it || if anyone has any tips let me know! ||
                </small>
                </li>

            <li class="list_item">
                If the sentence is just a fragment, still place double vertical lines (||) at the end of the sentence.
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <small>
                    <u>For example:</u> 
                    Checking out a book || 
                </small>
            </li>

            <li class="list_item">
               Enclose all punctuation within the double vertical lines.
               <br/><br/> &emsp;
               <small>
                <u>For example:</u> 
                I am really excited about the weather today! || It's so nice outside... ||
               </small>
            </li>

            <li class="list_item">
                If there is a list of steps or bullet points, segment each bullet point into its own sentence.
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <small>
                    <u>For example, the following list:</u>

            <li class="list_item">
                If there are any hyperlinks or email addresses, please include them in their own sentence (there should be a set of vertical bars before and after the link/email). Do this even if doing so will break up a sentence. If the email address and the vertical bars before and after were to be removed, the sentence should still be segmented correctly.
                <br/><br/> &emsp;

                    <u>For example:</u>

                If there are any emojis or emoticons, try to include them in whichever sentence seems closest to you.
