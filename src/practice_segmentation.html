            Please read the following rules carefully. These rules will apply to both the practice questions and the task you will be doing following the practice questions.

    <div class="list_container" id = "task_list_intro">
        <p>
            <strong>Please carefully read the following rules:</strong>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="list_item">
                Whenever you think a sentence ends, please place double vertical lines (||) at the end of the sentence. 
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <small>
                    <u>For example:</u> 
                    I walked to the store today. || I didn't buy anything, though. ||
                </small>
            </li>

            <li class="list_item">
                If there are any run-on sentences, please break them up to the best of your abilities. 
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <small>
                    <u>For example:</u> 
                    Has anyone else looked at the class homework yet || I have not and I don't know how to do it || if anyone has any tips let me know! ||
                </small>
                </li>

            <li class="list_item">
                If the sentence is just a fragment, still place double vertical lines (||) at the end of the sentence.
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <small>
                    <u>For example:</u> 
                    Checking out a book || 
                </small>
            </li>

            <li class="list_item">
               Enclose all punctuation within the double vertical lines.
               <br/><br/> &emsp;
               <small>
                <u>For example:</u> 
                I am really excited about the weather today! || It's so nice outside... ||
               </small>
            </li>

            <li class="list_item">
                If there is a list of steps or bullet points, segment each bullet point into its own sentence.
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <small>
                    <u>For example, the following list:</u>

                    <br/><br/>&emsp;
                    <u>would become</u>

                </small>
              </li>

            <li class="list_item">
                If there are any hyperlinks or email addresses, please include them in their own sentence (there should be a set of vertical bars before and after the link/email). Do this even if doing so will break up a sentence. If the email address and the vertical bars before and after were to be removed, the sentence should still be segmented correctly.
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <small>
                    <u>For example:</u> 
                     For concerns about the job posting at || google.com ||, please email the recruiter at || recruiter@recruiter.com ||
                </small>
            </li>

            <!-- <li class="list_item">
                If there are any timestamps, please include them in their own sentence (there should be a set of vertical bars before and after the timestamp). Do this even if doing so will break up a sentence. If the timestamp and the vertical bars before and after were to be removed, the sentence should still be segmented correctly.
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <small>
                    <u>For example:</u> 
                    I received a scam call at || (2020-05-23 20:43 +8:00) ||, which is an odd time to call.

            </li> -->

            <li class="list_item">
                If there are any emojis or emoticons, try to include them in whichever sentence seems closest to you.
                <br/><br/> &emsp;
                <small>
                    <u>For example:</u> 
                    I'm so happy :) || I ate some pancakes today! ||
